1. **String Reversal**

   Given a string, return a new string with reversed order of characters

```
"banana" => "ananab"
"helloworld" => "dlrowolleh"
```

2. **Palindrome**

   Given a string , return `true` if the string is a palindrome or `false` if it is not. Palindromes are strings that form the same word if it is reversed. Do include spaces and punctuation in determining if the string is a palindrome

```
"aba" => true
"abc" => false
```

3. **Integer Reversal**

   Given an integer, return an integer that is the reversed ordering of numbers

```
1234 => 4321
500 => 5
-500 => -5
```
